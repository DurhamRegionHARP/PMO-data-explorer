## About the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey
The findings described here are from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's *Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey* (OSDUHS). The OSDUHS is a biennial survey of students in Grades 7 to 12 with a focus on health behaviours and attitudes. Information from the OSDUHS is used to support the planning and evaluation of public health programs and services.
## Analysis Notes
Analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4. The results represent prevalence estimates as a percentage of the student population. Percentages are expressed as a point estimate with 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the estimate. This indicates the range that the true or actual percentage falls within 95 out of 100 times. In charts, the 95% CI is represented by an error bar.
### Data Release Guidelines
Results based on a small number of students are more likely to be unreliable. Results like these were supressed if they met any of the following conditions:
1. an estimate of less than 0.5%
2. a sample size, or denominator, less than 50 students
3. a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3%
